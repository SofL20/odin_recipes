            <li>120 ml (½ cup) unsweetened non-dairy milk (I use soy)</li>
            <li>80 g (⅓ cup) non-dairy yogurt (I use soy)</li>
            <li>100 ml (⅓ cup + 1 Tbsp + 1tsp) lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>120 g (½ cup) vegan block butter melted and cooled slightly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Syrup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>50 ml (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp) lemon juice</li>
            <li>50 g (¼ cup) caster or granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Icing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>130 g (1 cup + 1 Tbsp) icing (powdered) sugar sifted</li>
            <li>the juice of ½ - 1 lemon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/160℃ fan/350°F/gas mark 4. Grease an approx 11.5 x 21.5 cm / 4.5 x 8.5 in loaf tin and line with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour, cornflour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl then whisk in the ground almonds, sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon zest, milk, yogurt, lemon juice, vanilla extract and melted vegan butter.</li>
            <li>Whisk gently until no dry lumps remain but be careful not to over-beat the batter.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, pour into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 50-70 minutes until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. If the top starts 
                to colour too much before the cake is ready then loosely cover it with tin foil.</li>
            <li>While the cake is baking prepare the syrup - place the lemon juice and sugar in a small pan and heat gently while stirring until the sugar has 
                dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the cake is ready, set it aside to cool in the tin for 10 minutes then poke holes all over the top with a cocktail stick. Drizzle over the syrup, 
                making sure that you pour it around the edges as well, not just in the middle. Leave the cake to cool in the tin.</li>
            <li>Once the cake is cool, carefully lift it out of the tin using the strip of baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Place the sifted icing sugar in a bowl and gradually stir in enough lemon juice to form a thick but pourable icing. Drizzle the icing over the top of 
                the cake and serve. Store any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
