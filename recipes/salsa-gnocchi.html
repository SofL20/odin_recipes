                <li>Chop one of the tomatoes into small dice and set it aside for later</li>
                <li>Trim the onion, garlic and chilli</li>
                <li>Add the remaining tomato halves, onion, garlic, red wine vinegar, chilli and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the food processor</li>
                <li>Pulse until you have a chunky salsa (or use a knife to finely chop, if you prefer)</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Fry the gnocchi</h3></li>

                <li>Put the frying pan on a high heat</li>

            </ul>
            <li><h3>Add the salsa</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Tip the salsa into the frying pan and toss it through the gnocchi</li>
                <li>Once hot, remove from the heat and stir in the fresh chopped tomato</li>
                <li>Stir through most of the basil, reserving a few leaves for garnish</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3></li>
