            <li>1 onion (peeled and finely chopped)</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon marmite (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
            <li>100 ml dry white wine</li>
            <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>200 ml vegetable stock</li>
            <li>sea salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>12 vegan lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>120g vegan cheese (optional)</li>
            <li>fresh parsley or basil (finely chopped for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180 °C</li>
            <li>Place a wide frying pan or low-sided saucepan over medium heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, add the onion and fry for 2 minutes or until 
                softened. Add the garlic and fry for a further minute.</li>
            <li>Add the vegan mince and break up with a spatula. Fry off for a few more minutes or until the vegan mince is starting to brown. Add the carrot and 
                celery along with a splash of water to deglaze the pan and cook for a further 2 minutes or until the carrots and celery are softening.</li>
            <li>Add the dried herbs, tomato puree, marmite, light soy sauce, dry white wine, can of peeled tomatoes and vegetable stock. Use the spatula to break 
                up the tomatoes then leave the sauce to come to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Once simmering, lower the heat and allow the sauce to cook for around 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the vegan mince doesn’t burn. 
                Test the sauce and season with sea salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>If the lasagna sheets you’re using require pre-cooking, do this now in a large saucepan of salted boiling water. Do not cook the pasta for the full 
                amount of time stated on the packaging, only cook for half of the time stated.</li>
            <li>In a 22x33cm or 9x13 inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a thin layer of the vegan ragu. Spread across the base then arrange a layer of the pasta 
                sheets. Top with a layer of bechamel followed by another layer of pasta sheets. Repeat until the ragu has all been used up then top with a final 
                layer of pasta followed by a final layer of bechamel.</li>
            <li>Wrap the lasagna in tin foil/aluminium foil and place in the oven to bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the foil then top with 
                the vegan cheese (if using) and return the lasagna to the oven to bake for a further 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes before sprinkling with the fresh parsley or basil and serving.</li>
        </ol>
